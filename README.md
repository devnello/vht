## about
Valhalla Tracker aims to be a MIDI sequencing companion
for GNU/Linux audio setups. Adhering to Unix philosophy,
it tries to do one thing well.

- by itself produces no sound and won't run on Windowsâ„¢
- timing/input/output relies 100% on JACK
- probably most suitable for loop based music
- seems to work fine with fluidsynth, ZynAddSubFX and a MIDI controller
- minimalistic by design
- minimalistic by necessity
- can load and save files
- tries not to interfere but inspire
- for the same reason, sparsely documented :]
