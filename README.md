## about
Valhalla Tracker aims to be a perfect companion for your
JACK/Yoshimi/ZynAddSubFX/Calf setup. It relies 100% on JACK for timing
which allows sample-exact synchronisation and, in future, 
asynchronous rendering of projects.

## installation
The preferred method for now is:

`./setup.py install --user`

## dependencies
- python3-gobject
- jack-audio-connection-kit-devel

## roadmap before a file release
- [x] record/edit notes
- [ ] record/edit controllers
- [ ] triggers
- [ ] timeline
- [ ] loops
- [ ] export to wav
- [ ] configuration window
- [ ] some documentation

deadline: soon enough
